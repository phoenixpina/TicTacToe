# Overview

This is a program that runs a game of Tic Tac Toe, written in Java. The user can play against the computer, or they can play against another player locally. 

I wrote this software to learn the basics of the Java language. I am also an aspiring game developer, so this helps me further that goal.

# Development Environment

This program was written using the developer studio Visual Studio Code. To run Java, I downloaded and installed the Java Coding Pack downloaded from a link found below.

This program was written in Java, which is a programming language typically used to write apps for websites and mobile devices. This program uses two libraries, Scanner, which reads and stores user input, and Random, which generates random numbers when called upon.

# Future Work

- Making a GUI with the game board that looks good and isn't just strings printed in the terminal.
- Coding a simple AI that actually aims to win and isn't just a random number generator placing symbols randomly.
- Possibly splitting the code across multiple classes and files for improved readability.
